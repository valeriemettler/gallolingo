## Gallollingo

Gallolingo is a parody Duolingo clone for the Modern Gaulish language.

## Notes

I took great care in ensuring I did not steal any resources, and that any resources I used, especially fonts, were properly licensed, but I am not a lawyer, and am unsure of Duolingo's feelings towards my use of their format, even if I am attempting to tribute them (and only slightly poke fun at them), and even though I have no intentions of ever monetizing this project in any kind of way. This should not, to my knowledge, present any legal issues, but I respect Duolingo a great deal, and if they take issue with this project, I will happily remove it. 

## Specs

Powered by Ruby 2.3.1 and Rails 5
